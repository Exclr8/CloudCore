	<h3>ModelBusAdapter.csproj project</h3>
	    <p>
            The role of this project template 
            is to enable Domain Specific Languages created with the DSL Tools to be exposed 
            through the <b>ModelBus</b>.</p>
            This project 
        should not be created by itself but rather added to an existing DSL Tools solution at the same level as the Dsl.csproj and DslPackage.csproj. It is made of two T4 text templates that generate the ModelBusAdapter and AdapterManager for the existing DSL, 
        from the information located in the DslDefinition.dsl file of the Dsl project.
            
	<h3>What to do next?</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Next step is to open the <strong>projects properties</strong> and change the name of the assembly and of the default namespace to match 
                the names of the DSL to expose. For instance, as a best practice, if the DSL to 
                expose is named MyCompany.MyModel, the name of the assembly and default 
                namespace should be MyCompany.MyModel.ModelBusAdapter.csproj.<br />
                <br />
            </li>
            <li>Then, you should &quot;<strong>Transform All templates</strong>&quot; in order to generate 
                the ModelBus Adapter and AdapterManager for the model to be exposed.</li>
        </ol>
